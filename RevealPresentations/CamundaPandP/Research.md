## Product Strategy Input

### Matt U Feedback

Pretty high level for me...

Like:

- Design visuals are built into the product itself and don’t need to be maintained separately -> I rely on visuals like this to understand and remember how things work
- Qualitatively, it seems like Bard has become more productive since adopting Camunda
- You get some degree of logging and debugability basically for free

Don’t Like:

- We still often end up building things around it
- Is yet another tool/system to maintain and login to

I can’t comment much on better/worse vs other orchestrations from a dev or PO perspective beyond what’s listed above.

As for the future, a fair amount of long term product vision requires workflows built on top of workflows using worfklows, all drenched in business logic, and unlike the past 6 years, we can’t feasibly keep big chunks of the burden off SS’s plate by having PS bury large swaths of it in Encompass. Yeah, SS CAN code it all in Javascript and/or C#, but if a tool like this makes workflows easier for developers to maintain and scale business logic heavy workflows, then we should make an effort to get familiar with it and use it.
