                    <li>Implementation in IT</li>
                </ul>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    ### Standard:

                    BPMN is not owned by a certain enterprise but by an institution (OMG), which is already established
                    through other world-wide standards, e.g., UML. The standard is supported by many software products;
                    you are less dependent on any particular vendor’s products.

                    ### Simplicity

                    The principle behind BPMN is rather simple which is why you can start working with this notation
                    very quickly.

                    ### Power of Expression

                    If necessary, you can describe precisely how a process functions with BPMN. However, this is more
                    difficult than only roughly describing the process. This way of precise modeling is possible, but
                    not mandatory.

                    ### Implementation in IT

                    BPMN has been primarily developed to support technical implementation of processes (“Process
                    Automation”). The more important the IT is in a company, the more helpful the use of BPMN becomes.

                    BPMN is owned by the Object Management Group.

                    This group also owns standards such as Model Driven Architecture and UML

                    This means that by learning and building BPMN, we will create models that can be moved to other BPMN
                    implementations.

                <h3 data-id="title">Our First Workflow</h3>
                <hr data-id="line">
                <div class="bpmn r-stretch" src="\CamundaPandP\bpmns\StartTaskEnd.bpmn" zoom="3"></div>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Here is a very simple but valid BPMN model.

                    We start with a start event. The start event is a circle with a regular line stroke. Every model
                    must have at least one starting point.

                    The rounded rectangle is a Task. This is any unit of work that needs to be done. This unit of work
                    can be as granular as we need it to be, but should be written in the context of a single "business
                    step".

                    Finally we have an end event. While not technically required, it is good to explicity declare the
                    end of a process. The end event uses a thick line stroke to differentiate itself from other events.

                    Between each element of a workflow are sequence flows. A sequence flow is an arrow that indicates
                    the direction of the flow.

                <h3 data-id="title">Task Types</h3>
                <hr data-id="line">
                <div class="bpmn r-stretch" src="\CamundaPandP\bpmns\TaskTypes.bpmn" zoom="2.5"></div>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    There are several different possible task types. Here we have just four task types. Task types have
                    specific icons in their upper left-hand corner.

                    The user task is the top left task, with the user icon. It is for any task that a human or user
                    needs to accomplish. These might include approvals, or may be some task that has to physically
                    completed.

                    The service task is the top right task, with the two cogs icon. It is for any task that software
                    needs to accomplish. This might be a web service like a REST or SOAP call. Or it may be pulled off a
                    queue and worked by a worker service.

                    The receive task is the bottom left task, with the white envelope icon. It is for any task that
                    expects something to send it a message, whether it comes from internal or external sources. The
                    reverse of the receive task is the send task. The send task is a task that sends a message out. The
                    send task is the same envelope icon, but is black instead of white.

                    The script task is the bottom right task, with the curvy paper icon. Script tasks are any task given
                    a script that executes in the process engine. This could be a script written in JavaScript or Groovy
                    for example.

                    Here is a simple workflow made up of four tasks. The text inside the task rectangle describes the
                    business action being accomplished. Looks like a user, such as the Loan Officer, has to get the
                    borrower's employer address. Then a service verifies the address. A script calculates the commute
                    fees that apply. Then another service updates Encompass.

                <h3 data-id="title">Gateways</h3>

                <div class="bpmn r-stretch" src="\CamundaPandP\bpmns\SimpleCreditScoreGateway.bpmn" zoom="1.6"></div>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Gateways are used in BPMN to control the flow of the process. They allow for modelling decisions
                    based on data, events, and allow concurrency and parallelization.

                    In this workflow, we get the borrower's credit score, then we decide if the credit score is good
                    enough. Depending on whether the credit score is good enough decides if we send an approval letter
                    or a denial. The gateway is the diamond with the X in the middle. The X tells us it is an exclusive
                    OR gateway, which means it can only move down one sequence flow; we can't send both an approval and
                    a denial!

                    The gateway in this case is a question, and each sequence flow is a possible answer.

                <div class="bpmn r-stretch" src="\CamundaPandP\bpmns\GatewayTypes.bpmn" zoom="3.8"></div>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Just like there are many possible task types, there are several different gateway types.

                    The first and most common is the Exclusive Gateway. It is identified with an X in the middle of the
                    diamond. An exclusive gateway can only output to one matching sequence flow (like an Exclusive OR).
                    If more than one sequence flow match, the process is invalid.

                    The second is the Parallel Gateway. It is identified with a plus in the middle of the diamond. A
                    Parallel gateway can output to multiple sequence flows. It will always output to every sequence flow
                    coming out from it. It is used to show concurrent flows.

                    The third is the Inclusive Gateway. It is identified with a circle in the middle of the diamond. An
                    inclusive gateway can output to one or more matching sequence flows (like an inclusive OR). If none
                    of the sequence flows match, the process is invalid. This gateway might or might not create parallel
                    flows, and must be used with care.

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Here is a more complicated version of the credit score workflow we saw before.

                    A parallel gateway is used to get the credit score from all three credit reporting agencies at the
                    same time. The parallel gateway on the other side is a merge gateway. It converts the three
                    concurrent sequence flows back into a single sequence flow. Because it is also a parallel gateway,
                    it knows to wait for all three tasks to complete before moving forward to the calculate step.

            <section>
                <h3 data-id="title">Events</h3>
                <hr data-id="line">
                <div class="bpmn r-stretch" src="\CamundaPandP\bpmns\EventTypes.bpmn" zoom="3.8"></div>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    The last element we are going to discuss is Events.

                    Events are indicated by double circles, and there are several different event types. Events can
                    exist on their own (similar to a task), or they can be attached to a task to modify or enhance it.

                    The left event is a timer event. A timer event can be set to go off at a specific datetime, at a
                    relative datetime from current, or to cycle every specified duration.

                    The right event is a signal catch event. A signal is like a message, but it broadcast to everyone
                    listening. A message is supposed to be a one-to-one communication. A signal is a one-to-many
                    communication.

                    <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                        We've added two timer events into our credit score workflow. The top one is a stand-alone event
                        that waits one day after the approval letter is sent. Then a user is assigned to follow up with
                        the borrower.

                        The bottom one is attached to the Send Denial task. If the task takes 3 days, the timer will
                        interrupt the task, and alert the loan team to keep us in compliance.

                    Along with the standard visual notation, BPMN also has an XML standard also owned by OMG. This XML
                    contains all the data needed to visually notate the model, including all names, types, and x y
                    coordinates.

                    This makes BPMN models easily computer readable, and is easy to manage in source control.

                    Here we have the credit score workflow we've been working through, but now it has been deployed to
                    Camunda.

                    This is the Cockpit. The Camunda engine has a couple web apps available for us to access through our
                    mundane accounts (thanks Blair and Tim!). Everyone has access to these web apps, including Product
                    Strategy. The most common web app that we use is the Cockpit view, and we will focus this
                    presentation on this web app.

                    > *If live, start a new process instance*

                    Let's look at what a workflow looks like with a process instance running. Here we have an active
                    process instance on this workflow.

                    The bottom of the screen shows the process instances available, with links to their process instance
                    views. This list is searchable and filterable, which comes in handy when you have several process
                    instances running.

                    Let's click into that process instance.

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    > *If live, click into process instance*

                    Here we are looking at a single process instance.

                    The blue circle with a one in it is called a token. A token represents a state within a process
                    instance. This can tell us what step in the process we are currently working. For example, in this
                    process, we are on the wait step. This is a timer that will complete after a day.

                    Below the workflow, we have a list of variables for this process instance. This process has all
                    three scores, as well as the calculated average score. Here is where we start to see the power of
                    using Camunda. This process is still active, but I have easy access to the variables available, as
                    well as their values.

                    Not only can I see the variables and their values, I can even modify them on the active process! For
                    example, if something goes wrong because a value is out of expected bounds, the process will throw
                    an incident. Then someone (developer, PO, etc) can go in, verify the correct value, modify it, then
                    restart that step. This gives us a lot of control

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    > *If live, start a process and quickly navigate to it*

                    I know what you're thinking. This workflow has a parallel split, what does that look like?

                    Here we see a process instance that is still in the process of getting the three credit scores. This
                    time, we have multiple blue tokens, one on each credit score task. A process instance can have
                    multiple tokens on it, and depending on the complexity of that workflow can be processing many
                    parallel branches simultaneously. All of the tokens share a collection of process instance variables
                    that can each be accessed and modified by any of the running tokens.

                    Because we used a parallel gateway to merge the three tasks into one, it will wait until all three
                    tokens reach it, and then emit a single token to the next step.

                    So far we've only seen one process at a time. I am going to kick off many new processes so we can
                    see what it looks like!

                    Here we can see many different tokens in many different locations. This is where the process
                    instance search and filter comes in handy. I can also keep track of how many processes we have and
                    where, which can provide valuable insight into the workflow.

                    In addition to currently running processes, we can also take a look at the history of processes.
                    This lets us look at processes that have already completed, which paths they took, and can even look
                    at the final values of their variables.

                    In history, we can also turn on a heatmap. This view can give us an idea of how many processes go
                    down which paths at a glance. For example, in this workflow more denials are sent than approvals.
                    And we have never had to alert the loan team, which is nice!

                    > *If live, send process instance with throwIncident set to true*

                    The last thing we'll look at in this presentation is incidents. When Camunda encounters an error it
                    throws what is called an incident. An incident shows up on the workflow as a red token. Whenever an
                    incident is thrown, Camunda will stop the process instance in that step, and waits for manual
                    intervention. This let's us see at a glance what processes have problems, and what the problems are.

                    > *If live, go to process incident*

                    Here we can see the technical details of the incident. In this case, we have a full stack trace and
                    the associated activity and process instance. If we are lucky, we can use this incident to fix some
                    variable and restart the process. More likely it will be an error in the code somewhere, and we will
                    need to fix the code and migrate the process instance up to start using the fixed code.

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    Visual Workflow: We can draw out the expected workflow. This keeps everyone on the same page about
                    what should be happening, both devs on the team as well as POs. This helps prevent the black box of
                    code once we start adding new paths and branches. Non technical roles can easily see what the
                    changes will be, and can give insight into the business expectations of the workflow. This visual is
                    not just external documentation, but is the actual workflow that will be executed, so no dead
                    documentation or doc rot from not keeping up with changes.

                    Amazing REST interface: In addition to all the visual aspects demo'd today, there is a REST
                    interface for everything we saw today. The interface is clear, makes a lot of sense, and is well
                    documented. On team bard, we have started to regard the Camunda REST interface as the standard we
                    should strive towards. This interface is how we are able to integrate Camunda into our existing
                    systems with relative ease!

                    Built-in Versioning: Every time a workflow is deployed, it creates a new version in the engine.
                    Instances can continue in old versions; they don't stop working when a new version is released. But
                    we have the option of migrating process instances to new versions if we choose. This gives us a lot
                    of power when making changes and deciding whether it is backwards compatible or not.

                <p style="font-size: 75%;">"A fair amount of long term product vision requires workflows built
                    on top of workflows using

                <p style="font-size: 75%;">
                    Unlike the past 6 years, we can’t feasibly keep big chunks of the burden off SS’s plate by
                    having PS
                    bury large swaths of it in Encompass.

                    Javascript and/or C#, but if a tool like this makes workflows easier for
                    developers to maintain and scale business logic heavy workflows, then we should make an effort

                    Have to build tools around Camunda: Camunda isn't a one-stop shop for automation, but is one piece
                    of the puzzle. We still have to build integrations into and out of Camunda processes. Camunda also
                    should handle the actual logic of a business task, just orchestrate or coordinate the tasks into a
                    cohesive flow and handle the decisions. Applications still need to be built to run business logic.

                    YATM: In a ecosystem where we have a multitude of tools and systems we use everyday, Camunda is yet
                    another tool that has to be maintained, logged into, and understood.

                    Unfamiliarity: Camunda and BPMN modeling is new to many of us. This was not covered in our college
                    classes or bootcamps. We are still learning the best way to leverage this new tool. But our
                    experience so far has shown that this is a tool worth learning!

                    Here are some real use cases we have currently running in prod.

                    We use Camunda to orchestrate all of our RPA (robotic processing automation) work, allowing RPA to
                    focus on it's job and not on how to start or what to do after.

                    We also use Camunda handle asynchronous processing. In this case we can order a title, and we will
                    receive and process the multiple documents coming from a 3rd party over the 3 days following the
                    order.

                    Lastly we have cases of long running synchronous processes. These processes may take minutes to days
                    to complete and run.
